            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A key concept of this lesson was learning about versioning control and what a version control system (VCS) is. Version control is essentially one main repository for all project files in a shared space. This means that team members are able to check out files, make any additional changes, and then check them back in: thus solving the re-occurring issue of file sharing. Then comes the versioning control system (VCS), which automatically records file revision history, when the files were revised, what was revised or what is different about them, and merges these changes to the same file. This is beneficial because files cannot be overwritten, team members can work on a file at the same time, and the VCS allows you to revert back to an older version of the project if needed. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Another aspect of the VCS is the creation of repositories. A repository is created with files and directories so that developers can record their change history and start tracking their current status and different versions of the file they are working on. There are two different types of repositories: remote and local. A remote repository resides remotely on the server and is shared among multiple team members. A local repository resides on a local machine of an individual user. There are two ways to create a local repository, by creating a brand new repository or by cloning an existing remote repository onto your local machine. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A large portion of this lesson was spent learning about Git, and for good reason. Basically Git is an advanced version control system (VCS). But Git is different than other VCS in the way that Git thinks about data. Git stores data as a set of snap shots of a miniature file system so that every time you save the state of your project Git takes a picture of what all your files look like at that exact moment and stores that snapshot as a reference. If the file has not changed, Git will not store the file again but rather a link to the previous file it has already stored. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git: The Three States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An important part of Git is that it had three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your database locally. Modified entails that you have changed the data but not committed it (saved) to your database yet. And lastly staged refers to when you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. There are also three main sections of a Git project (just think of everything in threes): the Git directory, the working directory, and the staging area. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. And lastly the staging area is a file that stores info about what will go into your next commit (save). </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The last key concept from this lesson I want to discuss is the Git repository. As explained in highlight # 3 you can get a Git project by either initializing a repository in an existing directory or cloning an existing repository. Once you take either of these routes, you will have to understand how to make changes to the repository. You will need to commit snapshots of the changes you make into your repository each time the project reaches a state where you want to save. Keep in mind that each file in your working directory is in either the tracked or untracked state. There are many other command and codes to insert so that you can check the status of your files, track new files, and view your staged (or unstaged) changes. </p>
